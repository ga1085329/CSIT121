	<h1> Shrimp Alfredo </h1>
<h2> The way my mother makes it </h2>
<ul>
	<li> Fettuccine </li>
		<li> Cooked Shrimp </li>
			<li> Butter </li>
			<li> Creme cheese </li>
			<li> Heavy/whipping creme </li>
			<li> Chicken broth </li>
			<li> Garlic Cloves </li>
			<li> Parmesan cheese </li>
			<li> Salt and pepper </li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li> Boil water and add salt to cook the fettuccine, cook it according to the package </li>
	<li> While the fettucine boils add butter, chicken broth, heavy creme and garlic cloves to a pot. Then when the butter melts, add creme cheese so it can melt into the sauce.</li>
	<li> Then when the creme cheese has melted , let it bubble slightly then grate parmesan cheese into it and stir for about a minute. </li>
	<li> Once that has cooked for another minute add the shrimp to a seperate pan with butter and stir occasinally until they are fully cooked.</li>
	<li> Finally drain the fettuccine and add it to the sauce and serve with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is my favorite recipe because I love shrimp alfredo with a passion. I have tried it from every where that makes it but the only one that can never go wrong is the one that my mother makes. </p>
